explanation:
First I created a basic server using socket that takes a port number from the cmd line and the localhost ip.
this server would serve clients using the threading module. Then using the paramiko module documentation and
many examples online, I created a basic ssh server handler that rejects any failed logins from any user that
wasn't part of the usernames.txt and any invalid login that was tried less than 5 times. Before doing this, I 
had to change the .ssh/config on my machine to get around my client stopping at 3 ssh login attempts. Within
my ssh server handler class I have a function called check_auth_password() and in this function is where I 
handle counting how many failed logins there were. An interesting error I encountered was having the server 
disconnecting a client (seemingly legally?) after authenticating the 5th invalid login. This issue was solved
after I commented out a logging.info statement. I assume that I incorrectly set up my logging, but I found it 
very weird that there were no error messages whatsoever, which lead to a few hours of painful snooping around.
After all that, I implemented that after the client fails 5 times, the server makes a dummy shell that handles 
commands like ls, cat, pwd, cp, exit, and echo.
